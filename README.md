## Who Am I?
A seeker for in-depth work to achieve a high level in Data Science & Machine Learning. I have a certificate from DELLEMC and Professional Certificate For Python Data Science and Machine Learning From IBM.

Working as a Python Data Scientist and Machine Learning makes me feel more enthusiastic and passionate about what I'm doing. Giving life of what you've created is something really generous and flourish.

Currently, I'm working on improving my skills in ML and developing myself in MLOps methodology.


- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on Developing myself to build custom estimators & Embedders.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning more about Feature Engineering & custom estimators.
- üí¨ Ask me about ML ethics and how to start building your vision into a machine.
- üì´ How to reach me: Join my journey on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drxavier997/).
- ‚ö° Fun fact: 
  * Who doesn't like Ironman!! If you do, you must like how Jarvis corporate everything üòÑ.
  * That's why ‚Äì our generation like to have something like Jarvis. 
  * The Fun fact here, Jarvis now is not a fictional character ‚Äì it is now a fact.

## My Experience

- Have Solid knowledge about how to build pipleine as Data Scientist (starting from data clearning, going throw exploratory data analysis EDA, until export model).

- How to build a pipeline as Machine learning Engineer (starting from data pre-processing, feature engineering, hyper-parameter tuning and cross-validuation, until reaching deploying model).

- Know how to write models' prototypes in jupyter.

- Capable build advanced and explainable models that predict and forecast outcomes.

- Know how to build deployed models that build to production.

- Have the ability to deliver actionable business insights and incubate innovative ways of solving problems and founding solutions.

- The deployment process will not be efficient if there is no solid research behind it. So, I'm capable create a sophisticated technical report that emphasizes the workflow behind the development process.

- The main goal is to finish what you start: "clients do not relate to reasons, they relate to actions.

- Discipline, persistence, well-adapted are keys for a successful person; that's why ‚Äì I make them my big picture.

- Communication is not always the best thing, but being convenient is the best, especially with the stakeholders.
