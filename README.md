## Who Am I?
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer who's working on real-world problems with an orchestrated, fully designed, and scalable machine learning system to help better flexible life.

Also, I am Professional Machine learning Engineer from Google Cloud & Certified Data Scientist from IBM ‚Äì working for bringing the industrial experience of the best two companies in AI & ML. These certificates help me have a vision and better decisions in building and orchestrating ML systems.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on Developing myself in Designing & Developing orchestration systems.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning more about Statistics & Computational thinking & System Design.
- üí¨ Ask me about ML ethics and how to start building your vision into a machine.
- üì´ How to reach me: Join my journey on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ai-ahmed/).
- ‚ö° Fun fact: 
  * Who doesn't like Ironman!! If you do, you must like how Jarvis corporate everything üòÑ.
  * That's why ‚Äì our generation like to have something like Jarvis. 
  * The Fun fact here, Jarvis now is not a fictional character ‚Äì it is now a fact.

## My Experience

- Have Solid knowledge about how to build pipelines as Data Scientist (starting from data cleaning, going throw exploratory data analysis EDA, until export model).

- How to build a pipeline as Machine Learning Engineer (starting from data pre-processing, feature engineering, hyper-parameter tuning and
cross-validation, until serving the model) using Tools like TFX, Kubeflow, Apache Beams, and Airflow.

- How to convert business requirements into CI.

- Capable build advanced and explainable models that predict and forecast outcomes.

- Capable build advanced and explainable models that predict and forecast outcomes using orchestration artefacts for CT.

- Capable of framing & architecting any ML problem.

- ML code is 5% of any project. Hence, all the focus will be on monitor & measure for optimizing the performance of our model.

- The deployment process will not be efficient if there is no solid research behind it. So, I'm capable create a sophisticated technical report that emphasizes the workflow behind the development process.

- Have the ability to deliver actionable business insights and incubate innovative ways of solving problems and founding solutions.

- The deployment process will not be efficient if there is no solid research behind it. So, I'm capable create a sophisticated technical report that emphasizes the workflow behind the development process.

- The main goal is to finish what you start: "clients do not relate to reasons, they relate to actions.

- Discipline, persistence, well-adapted are keys for a successful person; that's why ‚Äì I make them my big picture.

- Communication is not always the best thing, but being convenient is the best, especially with the stakeholders.
